Four steps:
1) Install hypervisor, virt-manager
2) Bring up a Centos Vm Instance
3) Login to Vm
4) ssh to Vm

Virt-manager:
  sudo apt-get install virt-manager
Bring up Centos Vm:
Download image, say centos7_bangpydemo.qcow2 from  http://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/images/
Create a new guest machine following the instructions at,
  https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Virtualization_Host_Configuration_and_Guest_Installation_Guide/chap-Virtualization_Host_Configuration_and_Guest_Installation_Guide-Guest_Installation_Virt_Manager-Creating_guests_with_virt_manager.html
Try to boot the virtual instance. If it throws error as, "No bootable device", refer this post and fix it,
  http://serverfault.com/questions/675437/boot-failed-virt-manager-fails-to-load-qcow2-image && http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1638708
Login to Vm:
  Now, try to login as root user into the VM. If it asks for password authentication, use guestfish to remove password for root user,
    https://access.redhat.com/discussions/664843%60
  Now you must be able to login into vm via virt-manager
  Run ifconfig inside Vm to get eth0 IPAddress. If eth0 is not up and running,
    http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/36705/why-the-default-eth0-interface-is-down-by-default-on-centos
  and reboot the Vm
  Note down eth0's Ip address.

ssh to Vm:
  Try ssh root@vmIp. It may fail, because ssh protocol by default doesnot allow ssh login with empty passwords.
  Add these three lines to /etc/ssh/sshd_config,
    StrictModes yes 
    PermitEmptyPasswords yes
    PermitRootLogin yes
  Restart ssh daemon as, sudo service sshd restart
  Confirm, you are able to do, ssh root@vmIp from the host machine

Now, all the necessary resources are set up in place.
Go through the presentation in github repo, bangpy-aug-saltstack/present/index.html and do those steps, as much as you can before coming for the workshop
